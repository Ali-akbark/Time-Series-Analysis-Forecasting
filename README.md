# Time Series Analysis & Temperature Forecasting (ARIMA)

This project focuses on forecasting temperature using **time series analysis** with the **ARIMA** model.  
The goal is to understand temporal patterns in temperature data and build a predictive model that can forecast future values.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Perform end-to-end **time series analysis** on temperature data
- Explore trends, seasonality, and patterns
- Build and evaluate an **ARIMA-based forecasting model**
- Visualize actual vs predicted temperatures

---

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Used

- Time Series Analysis
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Stationarity, ACF, PACF
- Data preprocessing & visualization
- Model evaluation (error metrics)
